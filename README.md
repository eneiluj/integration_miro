Miro integration lets users create boards, share board links in Talk and open boards directly from Nextcloud.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### User settings

The account configuration happens in the "Connected accounts" user settings section.

A link to the "Connected accounts" user settings section will be displayed in the widget
for users who didn't configure a Miro account.

### Admin settings

There also is a "Connected accounts" **admin** settings section if you want to allow
your Nextcloud users to use OAuth to authenticate to Miro.
